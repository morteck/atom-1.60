Atom is only available for 64-bit Linux systems.

Configure your distribution's package manager to install and update Atom by following the Linux installation instructions in the Flight Manual. 
You will also find instructions on how to install Atom's official Linux packages without using a package repository, though you will not get a
utomatic updates after installing Atom this way.

Archive extraction: https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.60.0/atom-amd64.tar.gz

An archive is available for people who don't want to install atom as root.

This version enables you to install multiple Atom versions in parallel. It has been built on Ubuntu 64-bit, but is also compatible with Arch Linux 
and it's forked distrobutions (manjaro, endeavourOS, Artix etc..)

Ensure that your OS is up to date with the AUR before installing.

$ sudo pacman -Syu (update pacman database)
$ yay (update & sync with AUR repositories)

Install dependancies: 

$ yay -S git libasound2 libcurl4 libgbm1 libgcrypt20 libgtk-3-0 libnotify4 libnss3 libglib2.0-bin xdg-utils libx11-xcb1 libxcb-dri3-0 libxss1 
libxtst6 libxkbfile1 && reboot

You may need to install some dependencies from the AUR as I had some issues locating them in the pacman database. 

1. Download atom-amd64.tar.gz from the https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.60.0.
2. Run tar xf atom-amd64.tar.gz in the directory where you want to extract the Atom folder.
3. Launch Atom using the installed atom command from the newly extracted directory.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases. 
You must ensure that you are using release 1.60; ver 1.63 is not compatible with Linux. 

You may be able to run version 1.63 in MS Windows. I'll update this repository once I've tested this.
